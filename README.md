# PolyAsciiShellGen: alphanumeric shellcode encoder

PolyAsciiShellGen is a simple alphanumeric shellcode encoder coded in C. This program automates the Riley Eller's technic [1] to bypass MSB data filters, for buffer overflow exploits, on Intel platforms. It provides extra functionnalities such as the NOP sleed generation and the size optimisation. It takes a shellcode to encode in entry and return a printable shellcode directly useable. 



## Synopsis

Getting and building the PolyAsciiShellGen program.

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/VincentDary/PolyAsciiShellGen.git
$ cd PolyAsciiShellGen
$ make && make clean
```
Usage.

```
$ ./PolyAsciiShellGen
usage: PolyAsciiShellGen <esp offset> <nop sleed factor N * 4 NOPS> <shellcode "\xOP\xOP"...>
```

## Description

 PolyAsciiShellGen takes a shellcode in entry, it encodes the shellcode in ASCII format, and then it builds a decoder/loader with printable opcodes which wraps the encoded shellcode. This program automates and optimizes the shellcode encoding process in ASCII format describe by Riley Eller in this paper [2]. Moreover, this article shows how to build a machine code which decodes and loads a encoded shellcode with a reduce set of x86 printable opcodes. The resulting machine code in printable format, realises the following operations to load, and to execute the original shellcode in the memory:


"move the stack pointer just past the ASCII code, decode 32-bits of the original sequence at a time, and push that value onto the stack. As the decoding progresses, the original binary series is "grown" toward the end of the ASCII code. When the ASCII code executes its last PUSH instruction, the first bytes of the exploit code are put into place at the next memory address for the processor to execute. "

PolyAsciiShellGen provides extra functionnalities in addition of automates the Riley Ellerâ€™s technique. It allows to add an extra NOP sleed between the shellcode loader and the decoded shellcode in order to reliable the exploit. Moreover, it optimises the shellcode encoding process in order to return an ASCII shellcode as small as possible.

## Options and return value

- **__esp offset__**

The esp offset parameter allows to adjust the position of the stack pointer from its original position, when the loader code is executed. This value can be very useful to add an extra NOP sleed between the shellcode loader and the builded shellcode. This paramater can be a positive or a negative value.


- **__sleed factor__**

The NOP sleed factor parameter allows to add a nop sleed bridge between the shellcode loadder and the builded shellcode. This parameter is an integer which allows to add nop instructions by group of four bytes. This nop sleed must be used to reliable the exploit, not to set the shellcode padding.


- **_shellcode_**

The shellcode parameters is the shellcode in escaping format "...\xcd\x80...". If the lenght of the shellcode in entry is not a multiplier of four bytes, it is padded with extra nop byte.


- Return value

The return value of this command is the printable encoded shellcode. The resulting printable encoded shellcode is generated randomly between each execution. So, you can generate a set of printable encoded shellcode with different signatures from one original shellcode. The ASCII characteres set use for the encoding is the following:
"%_01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-".
